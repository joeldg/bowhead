# **THIS PROJECT WILL NOT BE MAINTAINED MOVING FORWARD**
## I AM LEAVING IT HERE BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF INTERESTING DATA (arrays) THAT CAN BE REUSED IN OTHER PROJECTS.


UPDATE (4/6/2018) see follow-up: https://medium.com/@joeldg/cryptocurrency-bot-framework-followup-3bc289322fb1

UPDATE (3/15/2018) I'm still here, left my old job, started a new job and been hectic. Work will resume on Bowhead this weekend.

UPDATE (2/8/2018): **COMMANDS ARE PROBABLY BROKE** updated project to Laravel 5.6 and made changes to coinigy data getter.

UPDATE (1/30/2018): **COMMANDS ARE PROBABLY BROKE**, I am still cleaning up from the Bitfinex issues. To summarize, Bitfinex no longer allows accounts from the United States, earlier version of Bowhead was very tied to Bitfinex for data. The recent work is adding Coinigy and CCXT support so Bowhead will work for more than 90 exchanges. I have a full time job a one-year old son, so I have limited time and do as much as I can, so I apologize that it is still being fixed.

CURRENT BOWHEAD ROADMAP:
1. (currently **20%**) Finish the web main page (initial, graphs, signals and indcators)
2. Finish the strategy builder page (+ backtesting, strategy stats, stub out sections for future ML articles)
3. Finish Strategy class.
   * Add social strategy page, upload your own strategies for the community, download strategies to work with and backtest.
4. Import all current Bowhead strategies into the new Strategy builder.
   * Add strategy builder hooks to web main page
5. Finish the web interface arb page (arbitrage matrix)
   * Add strategy builder hooks to arb page
6. Finish the settings page with auto-update options, paper/live trading options, alerts and so on.
7. Create docs section with links.
8. Create stats and reports page (show trades, +/-, exchange fees breakdown, arb breakdown and strategy comparisons)
    --THEN--
9. Revisit each command and fix.
10. Revisit all three Bowhead articles and rewrite new versions.
11. Create cloud-based Bowhead data service, so that Bowhead can get historical and realtime data from ALL exchanges with no API keys. Only provide API keys for those you wish to trade on.
    * Update Bowhead to use data service
12. Create YouTube video series on Bowhead, strategies etc.
13. Get some sleep

Then, hopefully we can start the ML series for Bowhead.

UPDATE (1/26/2018): Vastly cleaned up the web configuration and verified it works with Postgres, and Timescale hypertables (http://timescale.com).

UPDATE (1/08/2018): PREVIEW of the official Docker container, with partial web configuration. Container is using Alpine Linux+Nginx+PHP7.1 with MariaDB and Redis. ... Still a work in progress, but, it will connect to coinigy -or- your ccxt accounts and pull ticker data into the database on the pairs you select in the web interface.

```
docker pull joeldg/bowhead

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 joeldg/bowhead

open http://localhost:8080/setup
```
Then you will need to wait, it takes a while for it to fire up because of the composer update it needs to do.
When it comes up, it will be on port http://{IP}:8080/setup

a REST-API and console-based cryptocurrency trading bot boilerplate and framework
Written by Joel De Gan, 2017


Bowhead (a type of whale) is the codename for a boilerplate within Laravel for building 
Cryptocurrency and Forex automated systems.

Utilizing a RESTful API, Bowhead can be used as a middle-layer for your favorite language
to interface with multiple brokerages and market makers, just add your API keys.

Bowhead utilizes all the TALib functions implemented in the Trader extenstion for PHP
and creates some of it's own indicators which are composites of those from TALib.

#### Focus of the project.
The primary focus is to have an easy to use boilerplate/framework that you can 
rapidly create a fully functional trading system on various strategies on 
BTC funded trading platforms that typically do not require that you are "verified"
this way you can trade with funds without funneling them through your bank and
having to deal with some potential tax issues (depending on the country you live in)

#### Companion article
This project has a companion article which walks you through how to set it up and walks you through 
setting up your first strategy and running it on [Whaleclub](https://whaleclub.co/join/tn6uE) 
and on [1Broker](https://1broker.com/?r=21434), which you will need accounts on both. 
Additionally the following are recommended exchnges:
* [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=12325729)
* [Coinbase/GDAX](https://www.coinbase.com/join/51950ca286c21b84dd000021)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com)
* [CEX](https://cex.io/r/0/joeldg/0/)

Usage of [Coinigy](https://www.coinigy.com/?r=32d4c701)(free 1-month trial) also is being added.
 
The companion article is on Medum and is:

Part 3: [Let’s write a cryptocurrency bot (part 3)](https://medium.com/@joeldg/lets-write-a-cryptocurrency-bot-part-3-826d65e55184)

I highly suggest you read through it and follow along to get it up and running.

#### basic setup
You will need 
* PHP7.1
* Redis
* MySql 
* the PHP Pecl Trader extension, 

for Python
you will need the dotenv package. 
````
pip install python-env
````

#### Notes
This project was initially done in the Laravel-Lumen (lightweight) framework 
however the move to a fully open sourced boilerplate/framework I felt that having the 
full ability of Laravel could be important, particularly Jobs and other parts which
utilize queues could be invaluable.

Bowhead was written and tested on a Mac and I have it running in the cloud on an
Ubuntu linux server in AWS making real money trades every day on the Crypto
markets, on Forex pairs and on binary options.

One limitation that may mess up this running on Windows is the usage of a
named pipe for passing data between Python and PHP in real time, there are
ways around this, such as using Redis, or piping the output to a parser. 

I am open to suggestions for how to get it to work on Windows
 
#### A note about editors. 
> I would like to additionally say that when you are working with Laravel, it
 it is almost mandatory to use an editor like PHPStorm, you 'can' use something like
 Atom but it would be like trying to use notepad to work on a dotNet project,
 you can technically 'do it' but it will be frustrating and you will not have
 a good time.  I cannot recommend PHPStorm more highly. They have a free trial
 and with updates it extends the trial period, even still, if you choose to purchase
 it, it's not expensive.
 
#### additional libraries
 I have added a couple utility libs that I like to use with this.
 
 - Console class, this is for colorizing, doing progress bars and doing text tables in console which look like the following.
````
 ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
 ║ BTC    │                                      ║
 ║ LTC    │                                      ║
 ╚════════╧══════════════════════════════════════╝
````

If you feel in a tipping mood send BTC to
````
14d9xxG1h5DkaDihiDBwzp5nj82dTcWfHc
````

DONE:
1) Write my own Coinbase, Whaleclub, 1Broker wrappers.
2) Create Indicators wrapper for TALib.
3) Create Candles wrapper for TALib
4) Collect console functions into one Console class.
5) Streaming data from Oanda
6) Streaming data from Bitfinex
7) Dockerfile easy-setup done and tested.
8) Signals module
9) Strategies module
10) REST mapping module

IN PROGRESS:
1) REST-API 
2) Write my own Oanda, Bitfinex and Poloniex API wrappers.

TODO:
1) Standardize the calls to brokerages so the method names are the same across all of them.
2) reporting, logging and backtesting tools.
